    "The above list is by no means exhaustive. They are just some of the motivations for performing experiments for machine learning model development. When these experiments are performed, there is a need to capture key results and connect the experiment to other related project activity. Key results could be python artifacts like a jupyter notebook or a computed object. Within reasonable size limits, any computed object that can be serialized to json can be persisted by Arangopipe. There is also a need to organize the data captured from the above experiments in a cohesive manner. Related project activities must be connected. For example a data scientist may want to connect a modeling experiment to project activity that performed exploratory data analysis or feature selection experiments. Personel working of machine learning projects must be able to query this data in an adhoc manner to obtain information that they or their co-workers had captured. This is the need for which Arangopipe was created. Arangopipe is a tool for machine learning metadata management using ArangoDB. Arangopipe provides multiple interfaces for working with Arangoppipe. An API interface is provided. This mode interaction is principally intended for data scientists or machine learning engineers. This notebook provides a brief tour of this interface. ArangoDB provides a web user interface that comes with a query tool . This can be used for querying data from Arangopipe. An independent user interface application with a search feature is also provided. Docker images with these features are available. Please see the [github](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe) repository for further details.\n",

    "ArangoDB is a multi-model database and supports both, a graph and a document oriented data model. Machine learning experiments are very easy to describe using a graph representation. Arangopipe uses a very simple graph data model to capture data from machine learning experiments. This schema is flexible, an API to extend it is provided. See the [data dictionary](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/documentation/design/data_dictionary.md) for more information. Metadata from project activity are stored as documents as json serialized entities. In this notebook we provide a brief overview of tracking machine learning metadata using Arangopipe. For more information about Arangopipe, please see the [project](https://www.arangodb.com/machine-learning/) page. In this notebook, the following features are illustrated:\n",
    "1. Creating a project and registering it for tracking with Arangopipe\n",
    "2. Creating a dataset and register as an asset to be tracked\n",
    "3. Creating a featureset and register it as an asset to be tracked\n",
    "4. Developing a model and recording its performance as well its parameters with Arangopipe\n",
    "5. Saving the connection information so that it can be reused in another session to either query or update project information and activity.\n",

    "In this section, the details of capturing meta-data with Arangopipe as part of model building activity will be illustrated. Model selection is an important activity for data scientists. Data scientists consider many candidate models for a task. The best performing model is then chosen. This procedure is illustrated in the notebook illustrating the use of hyperopt to capture meta data from a hyper-parameter tuning experiment, (see [hyperopt.](https://github.com/arangoml/arangopipe/blob/master/arangopipe/tests/hyperopt/hyperopt_integration.ipynb)). We will use a simpler setting for this notebook. We will assume model selection has been completed and that a LASSO regression model is the best candidate for the task. Having made this decision, we capture information about the model and its parameters. This information is stored in Arangopipe. The details of performing these tasks are shown below. Before model building, we capture information related to the dataset and the features used to build the model.\n"
